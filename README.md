# Google Book Search
A React application using MongoDb to search and save books. 

As a User I want easy access to books.
So that I can read more while I'm stuck at home.
In order to relieve my boredom.

The application is very simple as a user enters on the landing page there is a button to direct them straight to the search area. A list of 10 books will appear with each search.

These results can be saved and or viewed. If the view button is clicked they will be taken to the online store from which it can be bought. If saved, it will be saved on the database for a time in the future or if they decide against getting it they can delete it from their saved list.
